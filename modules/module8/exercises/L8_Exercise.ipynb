    "1. Find a data set and upload it to your exercises folder in module 8. \n",

    "2. Write your R code **in this exercise notebook** to create your visualizations, and save them under `exercises` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a **narrative visualization document** using **any** software you want (Word, PowerPoint, Photoshop, etc.) by pasting your visualizations and creating all necessary elements (captions, text annotations, layout, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Save your end product as a **pdf file** and upload it to your exercises folder (**name it L8_Exercise.pdf**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you start with a clear message in mind, and filter and format your data accordingly, and create the visualizations that will **support that message**. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to have **at least one major visualization, and a number of supporting smaller graphs (2, 3, or more)**. Make sure to have a **clean layout**, and **enough text annotations and captions** to make your message clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose any type of visualization that you believe will be most **effective** for the type of data and the message you have chosen. \n",

    "# Common Pitfalls / Inefficiencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pay attention to the following in your visualizations and stories:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Color coordinate among plots so that the same data attributes have the same color in all plots\n",
    "\n",
    "you can do that by creating a manual palette and use it everywhere to make sure same color is always assigned to the same attribute value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perceptual grouping is important! group and/or order values\n",
    "\n",
    "In a bar chart, **order the axes** by time, value, etc. to make comparisons more intuitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pie chart: order wedges. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a bubble map, if you want to show trends, use grouping variable to **connect** bubbles, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### No lengthy text in x axis\n",
    "\n",
    "Flip the axes of a bar chart so that string values (text) are readable on the y axis left to right, \n",
    "\n",
    "**or** \n",
    "\n",
    "at least put them slanted in x axis for better readibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plot only those that tell an obvious story\n",
    "\n",
    "**No crowded** scatter plots with useless linear regression lines that don't tell anything. Look at alternative plots to tell your story.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you have too many classes (discrete variables/categories), try to group them \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of giving a color to each of them, you can put them in meaningful groups and color code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sequential variables, you can do the same thing by binning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stepped color palettes may be more useful than smooth sequential palettes (especially for comparison in choropleth maps).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can group/cluster data into meaningful chunks and display those as bubble charts, networks, geographical regions, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do NOT dump all the data in the plot unless there is a CLEAR pattern/clustering to it that can be perceived immediately. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ANNOTATE!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tell** your audience what they are supposed to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use meaningful titles with a message, not dry titles. \n",

    "Use text annotations (look at the **examples in the lab notebook**).\n",
